/******************************************************************************

In this lab, you need to create a C++ program that will give you an output of
the listed item below.

Task Scenario
A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned from ticket sales.
The remainder goes to the movie distributor. Write a program that calculates a
theaterâ€™s gross and net box office profit for a night. The program should ask
for the name of the movie, how many adult and child tickets were sold, and the
price of the adult tickets. The price of a child ticket is 60% of that of an
adult ticket. Assume the theater keeps 20 percent of the gross box office
profit.

Your program must display the following output:

Adult Tickets Sold:
Child Tickets Sold:
Gross Box Office Profit:
Net Box Office Profit:
Amount Paid to Distributor:
